# Jeopardy Game

This is another project within the scope of Codecademy's Data Scientist: Analytics Specialist learning path.

The main goal of this project is to practice writing several functions to:

1. filters the dataset for questions that contains all of the words in a list of words. Then compute the average value for the questions containing that specific list of words.

2. count of unique answers to all of the questions in a dataset.

3. investigate the ways in which questions change over time by filtering by the date. E.g, How many questions from the 90s use the word Computer compared to questions from the 2000s?

4. Investigate if there is a connection between the round and the category. Are we more likely to find certain categories, like "Literature" in Single Jeopardy or Double Jeopardy?

5. build a quiz system
